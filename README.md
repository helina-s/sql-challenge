# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I was able to utilize my SQL skills to design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, I performed: data engineering and data analysis.

#### Data Modeling
I used my SQL skills to inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.

#### Data Engineering
* Used the information I have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files (specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints).
* Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

#### Data Analysis

Once I have a complete database, I did the following:
1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

## Bonus
In this part I was able to import the SQL database into Pandas and:
  1. Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
  2. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.
